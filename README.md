Use strong, unique passwords. When you’re creating a password for your account, make sure to include a mix of numbers, symbols, and letters, both uppercase and lowercase. Avoid using the same passwords for multiple accounts. It’s harder to remember, but it will keep your information much safer.[1]
Try abbreviating a phrase. For example, “Soda at dinner keeps you up at night” could become “S@dKuU@n!”
Longer passwords are always stronger, so try using a favorite quote, or a line from a song, book, or movie. Remember that some websites have password length restrictions, so make sure to follow those as well.[2]
Avoid using common passwords like “123456” or “password,” or information about you that others might easily be able to find out, like a nickname, your street, or the name of a pet and don’t use the same password
Use a password manager to keep passwords safe and organized. Password managers automatically generate and store strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. You’ll simply create one master password for the manager and let it keep all the others safe. [3]
You can use some password managers for free, while more premium options are available for a fee.
Popular, trustworthy password managers include 1Password and LastPass. You can find others by searching for them online.
You can also use your browser’s built-in password syncing service, although it’s considered less safe and more vulnerable to hacking, so use with caution
